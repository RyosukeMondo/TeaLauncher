# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines requirements for improving TeaLauncher's architecture, testability, and code quality verification processes. After successfully migrating from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8 and from WinForms to Avalonia UI, the project requires architectural modernization to embrace contemporary .NET 8 best practices including Clean Architecture principles, SOLID design patterns, dependency injection, comprehensive testing, and automated code quality gates.

The improvements will transform TeaLauncher from a tightly-coupled legacy codebase into a maintainable, testable, and extensible application that supports future enhancements while maintaining its core principles of simplicity and performance.

**Value to Users:**
- **Developers**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend the codebase with clear architectural boundaries
- **Contributors**: Clear testing strategy and quality gates reduce risk of introducing defects
- **Maintainers**: Automated verification ensures code quality standards are consistently enforced
- **End Users**: Higher reliability through comprehensive test coverage and reduced regression risk

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature strongly aligns with TeaLauncher's product vision and technical objectives:

### Product Alignment (from product.md)
- **Reliability Goal**: "Zero crashes during normal operation" - comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- **Community Adoption**: Clean architecture and testability encourage community contributions
- **Configuration as Code Principle**: Testable configuration loading validates YAML correctness
- **Future Extensibility**: Plugin architecture and cross-platform support require solid architectural foundations

### Technical Alignment (from tech.md)
- **Modernization**: Embrace .NET 8 best practices including dependency injection and SOLID principles
- **Known Limitations**: Address "Test Coverage" limitation - expand beyond AutoCompleteMachine and ConfigLoader
- **Interface-based Patterns**: Extend existing interface patterns (ICommandManager*) throughout the codebase
- **Quality Tooling**: Implement missing static analysis and automated verification processes

### Structure Alignment (from structure.md)
- **Modularity Principle**: "Components communicate through well-defined interfaces"
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Testability Principle**: "Core logic isolated from UI for unit testing"
- **Dependency Rule**: UI depends on core, core never depends on UI

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized into clean architectural layers with clear dependency flow, so that business logic is isolated from UI and infrastructure concerns, making the code easier to understand, test, and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN the system SHALL organize code into four distinct layers: Presentation (Views), Application (Services), Domain (Models/Interfaces), and Infrastructure (Platform/Configuration)
2. WHEN dependencies between layers are analyzed THEN the system SHALL enforce that all dependencies flow inward (Presentation → Application → Domain, Infrastructure → Domain) with no reverse dependencies
3. WHEN business logic is examined THEN the Domain layer SHALL contain no dependencies on UI frameworks (Avalonia), infrastructure (file I/O), or platform-specific code (Windows API)
4. WHEN the Application layer is reviewed THEN it SHALL contain service interfaces and application orchestration logic without direct UI or platform dependencies
5. IF a component needs platform-specific functionality THEN it SHALL depend on an interface defined in the Domain layer, with concrete implementations in the Infrastructure layer

### Requirement 2: SOLID Principles Application

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow SOLID design principles, so that classes are focused, extensible, and maintainable with minimal coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - WHEN each class is examined THEN it SHALL have exactly one reason to change
   - WHEN CommandManager is refactored THEN command registration, command execution, and auto-completion SHALL be separated into distinct services

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - WHEN new command types are added THEN the system SHALL support extension through interfaces without modifying existing command execution code
   - WHEN new configuration sources are needed THEN the system SHALL allow adding new loaders without changing existing configuration logic

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - WHEN interfaces are implemented THEN derived types SHALL be substitutable for their base types without breaking functionality
   - WHEN ICommandExecutor implementations are swapped THEN all consumers SHALL work correctly

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - WHEN services are defined THEN they SHALL expose focused interfaces with no more than 5 methods per interface
   - WHEN clients depend on interfaces THEN they SHALL not be forced to depend on methods they don't use

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - WHEN high-level modules are examined THEN they SHALL depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations
   - WHEN low-level modules are examined THEN they SHALL implement interfaces defined by high-level policies

### Requirement 3: Dependency Injection Container

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dependency injection container managing object lifetime and dependencies, so that components are loosely coupled and can be easily tested with mock implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL configure Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection container with all service registrations
2. WHEN services are registered THEN the system SHALL use appropriate lifetimes: Singleton for stateless services, Scoped for per-operation services, Transient for lightweight objects
3. WHEN the main window is created THEN all dependencies SHALL be injected through constructor injection (not property or method injection)
4. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL allow replacing production services with mock implementations through the DI container
5. IF a service has dependencies THEN the DI container SHALL automatically resolve the entire dependency graph

### Requirement 4: Interface Extraction for Testability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all services defined by interfaces, so that I can substitute mock implementations during testing without depending on concrete classes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are examined THEN every service class SHALL implement at least one interface defining its public contract
2. WHEN CommandManager is refactored THEN interfaces SHALL be extracted: ICommandRegistry, ICommandExecutor, IAutoCompleter
3. WHEN YamlConfigLoader is examined THEN an IConfigurationLoader interface SHALL define the loading contract
4. WHEN WindowsHotkey is examined THEN an IHotkeyManager interface SHALL abstract platform-specific functionality
5. WHEN consumers use services THEN they SHALL depend only on interfaces, never on concrete classes

### Requirement 5: Pre-commit Code Metrics Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated pre-commit hooks verifying code metrics, so that code quality standards are enforced before changes are committed to version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git commit is attempted THEN the system SHALL automatically run pre-commit verification hooks using Husky.Net
2. WHEN file metrics are checked THEN the system SHALL reject commits with:
   - Files exceeding 500 lines of code
   - Methods exceeding 50 lines of code
   - Cyclomatic complexity exceeding 15 per method
3. WHEN code complexity is analyzed THEN the system SHALL use Roslyn analyzers or equivalent .NET tooling to calculate complexity metrics
4. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating which files/methods exceed thresholds
5. IF verification passes THEN the commit SHALL proceed normally without delays

### Requirement 6: Pre-commit Test Coverage Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks verifying test coverage thresholds, so that new code changes maintain or improve overall test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git commit is attempted THEN the system SHALL run all tests and generate coverage reports using `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
2. WHEN coverage is calculated THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum thresholds:
   - Overall line coverage: ≥ 80%
   - Branch coverage: ≥ 70%
   - Domain/Application layer coverage: ≥ 90%
3. WHEN coverage drops below thresholds THEN the system SHALL reject the commit with a detailed coverage report
4. WHEN new files are added without tests THEN the system SHALL warn developers and suggest creating corresponding test files
5. IF coverage verification takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL allow bypassing with `--no-verify` flag but log the bypass

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Unit Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests covering business logic with clear patterns and high coverage, so that core functionality is validated and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is examined THEN unit tests SHALL cover at minimum:
   - All Domain layer models and interfaces
   - All Application layer services (CommandRegistry, CommandExecutor, AutoCompleter)
   - All Configuration loading logic (YamlConfigLoader)
   - All public methods and edge cases
2. WHEN unit tests are run THEN they SHALL execute in under 5 seconds total
3. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern with clear test names describing scenarios
4. WHEN testing services with dependencies THEN tests SHALL use mocking frameworks (NSubstitute or Moq) to isolate the system under test
5. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN Domain and Application layers SHALL achieve ≥ 90% line coverage

### Requirement 8: Integration Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests verifying that components work correctly together, so that interface contracts and inter-service communication are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are examined THEN they SHALL test:
   - Configuration loading → Command registration → Command execution flow
   - YAML parsing → Service initialization → Hotkey registration flow
   - Real file I/O with test fixtures and temporary files
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use the real DI container with real implementations (not mocks)
3. WHEN integration tests are organized THEN they SHALL reside in `TeaLauncher.Avalonia.Tests/Integration/` directory
4. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL complete in under 15 seconds total
5. IF integration tests fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate which component integration failed and why

### Requirement 9: End-to-End Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end tests validating critical user workflows, so that the complete application behavior is verified from UI to command execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN e2e tests are examined THEN they SHALL cover critical workflows:
   - Application launch → Hotkey press → Input window display → Command execution → Window hide

2. WHEN e2e tests run on Linux THEN they SHALL use headless Avalonia testing without requiring Windows
3. WHEN e2e tests are organized THEN they SHALL reside in `TeaLauncher.Avalonia.Tests/EndToEnd/` directory
4. WHEN e2e tests are run THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds total
5. IF e2e tests fail THEN they SHALL capture diagnostic information (logs, state snapshots) for debugging

### Requirement 10: Test Documentation and Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the testing strategy and patterns, so that contributors understand how to write effective tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is examined THEN a `TESTING.md` file SHALL exist in the repository root describing:
   - Test categories (unit, integration, e2e) and when to use each
   - Testing patterns and conventions (AAA, naming, mocking)

4. WHEN new developers onboard THEN they SHALL be able to run `dotnet test` and understand test output
5. IF tests fail THEN error messages SHALL be descriptive enough to understand the failure without examining code

### Requirement 11: CI/CD Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines enforcing quality gates, so that only code meeting quality standards is merged into the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the CI pipeline SHALL automatically:
   - Build the project for all target platforms (win-x64, linux-x64)
   - Run all tests (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Generate code coverage reports
   - Run static code analyzers
2. WHEN quality gates are evaluated THEN the pipeline SHALL fail if:
   - Any test fails
   - Coverage drops below 80%
   - Build produces warnings
   - Static analyzer finds critical issues
3. WHEN the pipeline succeeds THEN coverage reports SHALL be published as build artifacts
4. WHEN coverage changes THEN the system SHALL post coverage diff comments on pull requests
5. IF quality gates fail THEN the pull request SHALL be blocked from merging until issues are resolved

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Layered Architecture**: Domain layer contains business logic and interfaces; Application layer contains services; Presentation layer contains UI; Infrastructure layer contains platform-specific implementations
- **Dependency Flow**: All dependencies point inward toward Domain layer; outer layers depend on inner layers, never reverse
- **No Circular Dependencies**: Project references form a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

#### Interface-Driven Design
- **Clear Contracts**: All service interactions defined by interfaces
- **Testability**: Every concrete class implementing an interface can be substituted with mocks
- **Minimal Interfaces**: Interfaces expose only necessary methods (ISP principle)

#### Code Organization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 500 lines per file, 50 lines per method
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum complexity of 15 per method
- **Namespace Alignment**: Folder structure matches namespace structure

### Performance

#### Test Execution Speed
- **Unit Tests**: Complete in ≤ 5 seconds total
- **Integration Tests**: Complete in ≤ 15 seconds total
- **E2E Tests**: Complete in ≤ 30 seconds total
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Complete in ≤ 30 seconds (including tests and metrics)

#### Application Performance (unchanged)
- **Startup time**: < 500ms application initialization (must not be degraded by DI container)
- **Hotkey response**: < 100ms from Ctrl+Space to window display (unchanged)
- **Memory usage**: < 25MB RAM during operation (small increase acceptable for DI container)

### Reliability

#### Test Coverage
- **Overall Coverage**: ≥ 80% line coverage, ≥ 70% branch coverage
- **Critical Layers**: ≥ 90% coverage for Domain and Application layers
- **Regression Prevention**: All bug fixes accompanied by tests reproducing the bug

#### Stability
- **Zero Test Flakiness**: All tests produce consistent results across runs
- **Deterministic Tests**: Tests do not depend on timing, external services, or environment variables
- **Test Isolation**: Tests can run in any order without affecting each other

### Maintainability

#### Code Quality Metrics
- **Automated Verification**: Pre-commit hooks enforce complexity, length, and coverage thresholds
- **Static Analysis**: Roslyn analyzers configured to catch common issues at build time
- **Consistent Style**: Code formatting rules enforced automatically

#### Documentation
- **Test Documentation**: Every test describes what it validates and why
- **Architecture Documentation**: Diagrams showing layer dependencies and data flow
- **Contributing Guide**: Clear guidelines for adding new features with tests

### Usability (Developer Experience)

#### Local Development
- **Fast Feedback**: Developers get test results within seconds
- **Clear Error Messages**: Failed tests and quality checks provide actionable information
- **Easy Setup**: `dotnet restore && dotnet build && dotnet test` works immediately after clone

#### CI/CD Integration
- **Automated Checks**: All quality gates run automatically on pull requests
- **Visible Results**: Coverage reports and test results visible in PR comments
- **Merge Protection**: Branch policies prevent merging failing code

### Security

#### Dependency Injection Security
- **No Service Locator**: Anti-pattern of requesting services from container discouraged; constructor injection only
- **Lifetime Management**: Singleton services verified to be thread-safe; no shared mutable state

#### Test Data Security
- **No Secrets in Tests**: Test configuration files do not contain real credentials or sensitive data
- **Isolated Test Files**: Temporary test files created in isolated directories and cleaned up after tests

### Compatibility

#### Cross-Platform Testing
- **Linux Test Execution**: All tests (including e2e) run on Linux development environments
- **Headless Testing**: UI tests use Avalonia's headless testing support, no display server required
- **Windows Targeting**: Tests verify Windows-specific functionality (hotkeys) through mocking or conditional compilation

#### .NET 8 Compatibility
- **Modern C# Features**: Use records, nullable reference types, init-only properties
- **DI Container**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection compatible with .NET 8 minimal hosting
- **Async Patterns**: Use async/await where appropriate for I/O operations
