# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical code quality issues preventing successful pre-commit verification. The current codebase fails three key quality gates: code coverage (61% vs 80% threshold), code metrics (2 methods exceeding maximum line count), and code formatting (28 whitespace violations). This feature will systematically resolve these issues to ensure all commits meet established quality standards, supporting the project's commitment to maintainability and reliability.

The value to developers includes:
- Automated enforcement of quality standards through pre-commit hooks
- Improved code maintainability through refactoring of overly complex methods
- Consistent code formatting across the codebase
- Higher test coverage ensuring better reliability and confidence in changes

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports TeaLauncher's success metrics and product principles:

**Success Metrics Alignment:**
- **Reliability**: "Zero crashes during normal operation" requires comprehensive test coverage to validate behavior
- **Code Quality**: Enforces standards that prevent technical debt accumulation

**Product Principles Alignment:**
- **Simplicity First**: Well-tested, properly formatted code is easier to understand and maintain
- **Fast Feedback**: Pre-commit hooks provide immediate quality feedback before code enters the repository
- **Configuration as Code**: Quality standards are codified and automatically enforced

**Technical Stack Alignment:**
- Leverages existing quality tools: dotnet format, coverlet, custom MetricsChecker
- Integrates with Husky.Net pre-commit hook infrastructure already in place
- Maintains consistency with established testing framework (NUnit 3.13.3)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Coverage Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to achieve ≥80% code coverage, so that I have confidence that the application is thoroughly tested and less prone to regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL report ≥80% line coverage across the TeaLauncher.Avalonia project
2. WHEN running `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` THEN the coverage report SHALL show no critical uncovered code paths in core services
3. WHEN the coverage check script runs THEN it SHALL pass without errors, confirming ≥80% threshold is met
4. WHEN new tests are added THEN they SHALL target currently uncovered code sections identified in the coverage report
5. IF a critical service method lacks tests THEN unit tests SHALL be created following existing test patterns (NSubstitute mocks, FluentAssertions)

### Requirement 2: Code Metrics Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all methods to be under 50 lines, so that the code remains readable, maintainable, and adheres to single responsibility principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running MetricsChecker THEN the system SHALL report zero method length violations
2. WHEN `CommandExecutorService.ExecuteAsync` (currently 68 lines) is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into helper methods each ≤50 lines
3. WHEN `AvaloniaDialogService.ShowDialogInternalAsync` (currently 81 lines) is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into helper methods each ≤50 lines
4. WHEN methods are refactored THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged, validated by passing all 267 existing tests
5. IF new methods are extracted THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names indicating their single responsibility
6. WHEN refactored code is committed THEN it SHALL maintain or improve cyclomatic complexity scores (max 15)

### Requirement 3: Code Formatting Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code to follow consistent formatting standards, so that the codebase is readable and merge conflicts are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` THEN the command SHALL complete with zero formatting violations
2. WHEN TestCommandLauncher project files are formatted THEN all 28 whitespace violations SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN formatting Test_AutoCompleteMachine.cs THEN the 13 whitespace violations (lines 89, 105-113, 132, 139, 150) SHALL be corrected
4. WHEN formatting Test_ConfigLoader.cs THEN the 15 whitespace violations (lines 65-71, 230-237) SHALL be corrected
5. IF `dotnet format` is run THEN it SHALL automatically apply .editorconfig rules consistently
6. WHEN formatting is applied THEN existing test functionality SHALL remain unchanged (all 267 tests pass)

### Requirement 4: Pre-Commit Hook Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks to validate all quality standards automatically, so that I cannot accidentally commit code that fails quality gates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `git commit` THEN Husky pre-commit hooks SHALL execute all quality checks in sequence
2. WHEN any quality check fails (coverage, metrics, formatting) THEN the commit SHALL be blocked with a clear error message
3. WHEN all quality checks pass THEN the commit SHALL proceed successfully
4. WHEN `dotnet husky run` is executed manually THEN it SHALL report the same results as the automated pre-commit hook
5. IF a developer needs to bypass hooks temporarily THEN they SHALL use `git commit --no-verify` with appropriate justification

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Refactored methods must each have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: New test files should follow existing project structure (Unit, Integration, EndToEnd directories)
- **Dependency Management**: New tests should reuse existing test fixtures and utilities (PerformanceTestBase, ServiceTestBase)
- **Clear Interfaces**: Extracted methods should maintain clean signatures with minimal parameters

### Performance
- **Test Execution Time**: New tests should not increase total test suite execution time by more than 20% (currently ~700ms)
- **Coverage Collection**: Coverage analysis should complete within 5 seconds
- **Format Verification**: `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` should complete within 10 seconds
- **Pre-commit Hook Duration**: Total pre-commit validation should complete within 15 seconds for quick feedback

### Security
- **Test Isolation**: New tests must not access production data or external systems
- **Mock Usage**: External dependencies (file system, process execution) should be mocked using NSubstitute
- **No Credential Exposure**: Test fixtures must not contain hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### Reliability
- **Test Stability**: New tests must be deterministic with zero flakiness (100% pass rate across 10 consecutive runs)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All 267 existing tests must continue passing after refactoring
- **Error Handling**: Refactored methods must maintain existing exception handling and error propagation

### Usability
- **Clear Test Names**: Test methods should follow pattern `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`
- **Readable Assertions**: Use FluentAssertions for expressive, readable test assertions
- **Documentation**: Complex refactored methods should include XML documentation comments explaining their purpose
- **Error Messages**: Coverage/metrics/format failures should provide actionable guidance for developers
