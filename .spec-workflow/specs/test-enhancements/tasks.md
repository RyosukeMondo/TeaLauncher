## Phase 1: Dialog Service Infrastructure

- [x] 1. Create IDialogService interface in Domain layer
  - Files:
    - TeaLauncher.Avalonia/Domain/Interfaces/IDialogService.cs
  - Create interface with three methods: ShowMessageAsync, ShowConfirmAsync, ShowErrorAsync
  - Add XML documentation for each method
  - Purpose: Define contract for UI dialog operations
  - _Leverage: Existing Domain/Interfaces patterns (ICommandRegistry, IAutoCompleter)_
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec test-enhancements, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Interface Designer with expertise in clean architecture and UI abstractions | Task: Create IDialogService interface in Domain/Interfaces/ following requirements 2.1 and 2.2. Define three async methods: ShowMessageAsync(string title, string message) returns Task, ShowConfirmAsync(string title, string message) returns Task<bool>, ShowErrorAsync(string title, string message) returns Task. Add comprehensive XML documentation explaining each method's purpose, parameters, and return values. Follow existing interface patterns from ICommandRegistry and IAutoCompleter in same directory. | Restrictions: Do not add any implementation logic (interface only). Do not add dependencies outside System namespaces. Use Task for async operations, not async void. Keep interface focused (no utility methods). | Leverage: Reference ICommandRegistry.cs and IAutoCompleter.cs in same directory for XML documentation style and namespace conventions. Use modern C# interface syntax. | Requirements: Requirement 2.1 (Dialog service contract definition), Requirement 2.2 (IDialogService methods for message, confirm, error). | Success: IDialogService.cs created with all three methods, comprehensive XML docs, compiles without errors, follows Domain layer conventions (no external dependencies), proper namespace TeaLauncher.Avalonia.Domain.Interfaces.

ShowMessageAsync: Wrap MessageBox.Show() in Task.Run or use Dispatcher.InvokeAsync, display message with OK button. ShowConfirmAsync: Create MessageBox with Yes/No buttons, return true for Yes, false for No. ShowErrorAsync: Call MessageBox with error icon/styling. All methods must be truly async (not sync wrappers). Add XML documentation. Create Infrastructure/UI directory if not exists. Use Avalonia 11.2.2 API (MessageBox may need window parameter for owner). | Restrictions: Do not block UI thread (use async properly). Do not show dialogs without window owner (will fail in headless). Handle null window owner gracefully for headless mode (detect and skip showing). Must implement interface exactly as defined. | Leverage: Reference Avalonia.Controls.MessageBox documentation. Reference existing Infrastructure services (WindowsHotkeyService, YamlConfigLoaderService) for implementation patterns and XML docs. Use async/await throughout. | Requirements: Requirement 2.3 (Production implementation using Avalonia MessageBox). | Success: AvaloniaDialogService.cs created in Infrastructure/UI/, implements all three interface methods correctly, uses real Avalonia MessageBox, handles async properly, XML documented, compiles without errors, namespace TeaLauncher.Avalonia.Infrastructure.UI.

Maintain private List<DialogCall> _dialogCalls to record all dialog invocations. DialogCall record should have: DateTime Timestamp, string DialogType ("Message"/"Confirm"/"Error"), string Title, string Message, bool? UserResponse. ShowMessageAsync/ShowErrorAsync: record call, return Task.CompletedTask. ShowConfirmAsync: record call, return pre-configured bool (default true, allow SetConfirmResponse(bool) to configure). Provide public methods: VerifyMessageShown(string title, string message) using FluentAssertions, VerifyConfirmShown(string title), GetDialogCalls() returning IReadOnlyList<DialogCall>, ClearDialogHistory(). Add XML documentation. | Restrictions: Do not use NSubstitute Substitute.For (this is a manual mock, not a mocking framework mock). Keep simple and focused. All methods must be synchronous operations returning Tasks (no actual async work). Follow AAA pattern in implementation design. | Leverage: Reference MockFactory.cs for test utility patterns. Use FluentAssertions for VerifyMessageShown (e.g., _dialogCalls.Should().Contain(call => call.Title == title && call.Message == message)).

  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec test-enhancements, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: DevOps Engineer with expertise in .NET dependency injection | Task: Register IDialogService in both production and test DI containers following requirement 2.5. In ServiceConfiguration.cs: Add services.AddTransient<IDialogService, AvaloniaDialogService>() in ConfigureServices method (Transient because each dialog interaction should be independent, no state to preserve). In TestServiceProvider.cs: Modify CreateWithMocks() to register MockDialogService, modify CreateWithRealServices() to use AvaloniaDialogService (but note it may fail in headless - document this). Add summary comments explaining lifetime choice. | Restrictions: Do not use Singleton (dialogs are stateless, Transient is correct). Do not modify other service registrations. Ensure proper using statements added for new namespaces. Follow existing registration patterns exactly. | Leverage: Reference existing service registrations in ServiceConfiguration.cs for pattern (see ICommandRegistry, IAutoCompleter registrations). Reference TestServiceProvider.CreateWithMocks() for test registration pattern.

Replace MessageBox.Show(title, message) with await _dialogService.ShowMessageAsync(title, message). Replace error MessageBox calls with await _dialogService.ShowErrorAsync(title, message). If any confirmation dialogs exist, replace with bool result = await _dialogService.ShowConfirmAsync(title, message). Ensure all calling methods are async (add async keyword, change return type to Task if needed). Update XML documentation on constructor. | Restrictions: Do not change MainWindow UI logic (only dialog calls). Do not remove existing error handling. Ensure all dialog calls are awaited. Do not make synchronous calls to async methods (no .Result or .Wait()). | Leverage: Read current MainWindow.axaml.cs to find all MessageBox usage locations.

Method signature: public static MockDialogService CreateMockDialogService(bool defaultConfirmResponse = true). Method should: Create new MockDialogService instance, call SetConfirmResponse(defaultConfirmResponse) if that method exists on MockDialogService, return the instance. Add XML documentation explaining the method and defaultConfirmResponse parameter. Follow existing MockFactory patterns (see CreateMockCommandRegistry, CreateMockAutoCompleter methods for style). | Restrictions: Do not modify existing MockFactory methods. Keep method simple and focused. Follow static factory pattern like other methods in file. | Leverage: Reference existing CreateMockCommandRegistry and CreateMockAutoCompleter methods in same file for implementation pattern and XML documentation style.

Create test: Constructor_WithDialogService_ShouldSucceed - Arrange: Create MockDialogService, Act: Construct MainWindow with test config path and dialog service, Assert: window.Should().NotBeNull(). Create test: ShowErrorDialog_CallsDialogService - Arrange: Create MockDialogService and MainWindow, Act: Trigger an error scenario in MainWindow that shows error dialog (may need to call internal method or simulate error condition), Assert: mockDialogService.GetDialogCalls().Should().ContainSingle() and verify dialog type is "Error". Add [TestFixture] attribute to class, use [SetUp] and [TearDown] for test isolation. | Restrictions: Do not test full MainWindow UI rendering (only dialog service integration). Keep tests simple and focused. Use AAA pattern. Do not duplicate existing MainWindow tests. | Leverage: Reference existing MainWindowTests.cs if exists. Use MockFactory.CreateMockDialogService() for mock creation. Use FluentAssertions for assertions.

Review CreateWithMocks() method - ensure IDialogService is registered as MockDialogService (should already be done in task 4, verify). Review CreateWithRealServices() method - CHANGE to use MockDialogService instead of AvaloniaDialogService because headless mode cannot show real dialogs. Add comment explaining why even "real services" uses MockDialogService for IDialogService (headless limitation). If CreateCustom method exists, ensure it defaults to MockDialogService unless explicitly overridden. | Restrictions: Do not break existing test service provider functionality. Do not use AvaloniaDialogService in any test scenario (will fail in headless). Ensure backward compatibility with existing tests. | Leverage: Reference task 4 changes to ServiceConfiguration and TestServiceProvider. Verify registration is correct.

If test expects error dialogs, verify via mockDialogService.GetDialogCalls() instead of catching dialog exceptions. For initialization failure tests: Verify error dialogs are shown via MockDialogService instead of expecting exceptions. Update test assertions to verify dialog content (title, message) using VerifyMessageShown or GetDialogCalls. Remove any try-catch blocks that were catching dialog exceptions. Ensure all 5 tests pass. | Restrictions: Do not change test intent (still test same scenarios). Do not skip tests or mark as [Ignore]. Maintain headless compatibility (no real dialogs). Follow AAA pattern in test structure. | Leverage: Use MockDialogService.GetDialogCalls() for verification. Reference MockDialogService.VerifyMessageShown for assertions. Read current failing test code to understand what they're testing. Maintain existing test names and structure. | Requirements: Requirement 1.1 (Use mock dialogs), Requirement 1.3 (All E2E tests pass). | Success: All tests in ApplicationLifecycleTests.cs pass, tests verify dialog interactions via MockDialogService, no dialog rendering exceptions, tests still validate application lifecycle correctly.
