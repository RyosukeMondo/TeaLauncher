# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical gaps in the TeaLauncher test suite identified after completing the architecture-testability-improvements initiative. While the project achieved excellent unit and integration test coverage (96.7% Application layer), all 17 end-to-end (E2E) tests are currently failing due to dialog infrastructure issues in Avalonia headless mode. Additionally, edge cases, performance validation, and test maintainability need improvement.

The test enhancements will:
- Fix E2E test infrastructure to enable complete user workflow validation
- Add comprehensive edge case coverage for critical services
- Implement performance tests to validate sub-100ms response time claims
- Improve test maintainability and documentation

**Value:** Ensures TeaLauncher's quality gates are comprehensive and reliable, covering not just code paths but actual user experiences and performance characteristics.

## Alignment with Product Vision

TeaLauncher's core value proposition is **fast, reliable command launching with sub-100ms response time**. This enhancement ensures:
- **Reliability:** E2E tests validate complete user workflows from hotkey to command execution
- **Performance:** Performance tests verify the sub-100ms response time claim
- **Quality:** Comprehensive edge case coverage prevents regressions in corner cases
- **Maintainability:** Better test infrastructure enables faster iteration and confident refactoring

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: E2E Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want E2E tests to validate complete user workflows in headless mode, so that I can verify the application works correctly without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an E2E test runs in Avalonia headless mode THEN the system SHALL NOT throw "Cannot show window with non-visible owner" errors
2. WHEN a dialog needs to be shown during E2E testing THEN the system SHALL use a mockable dialog service instead of direct MessageBox calls
3. WHEN all 17 E2E tests run THEN the system SHALL pass all tests successfully
4. IF the application is running in test mode THEN dialogs SHALL be captured for verification rather than displayed

### Requirement 2: Dialog Service Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI dialogs abstracted behind an interface, so that I can test dialog interactions without requiring a display server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs to show a message dialog THEN it SHALL call IDialogService.ShowMessageAsync() instead of MessageBox.Show()
2. WHEN the application needs to show a confirmation dialog THEN it SHALL call IDialogService.ShowConfirmAsync() instead of MessageBox.ShowDialog()
3. WHEN running in production THEN IDialogService SHALL be implemented by AvaloniaDialogService using real Avalonia dialogs
4. WHEN running in tests THEN IDialogService SHALL be implemented by MockDialogService for verification
5. IF MainWindow is constructed THEN it SHALL receive IDialogService via dependency injection

### Requirement 3: Edge Case Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive edge case testing, so that uncommon scenarios don't cause bugs in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command executor receives special characters in arguments THEN it SHALL handle them correctly (quotes, backslashes, unicode)
2. WHEN command registry receives unicode command names THEN it SHALL store and retrieve them correctly
3. WHEN auto-completer receives very large word lists (>1000 items) THEN it SHALL complete within 100ms
4. WHEN command executor handles concurrent executions THEN it SHALL not corrupt state
5. WHEN configuration loader encounters malformed YAML THEN it SHALL provide specific error messages with line numbers

### Requirement 4: Performance Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want guaranteed sub-100ms response time, so that TeaLauncher feels instantaneous.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses the global hotkey THEN the window SHALL appear within 100ms
2. WHEN a user types a command and presses Enter THEN execution SHALL start within 100ms
3. WHEN auto-completion is triggered THEN candidates SHALL be provided within 50ms
4. WHEN configuration is loaded at startup THEN it SHALL complete within 200ms
5. IF performance tests are run THEN they SHALL use Stopwatch for accurate timing measurements

### Requirement 5: Test Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maintainable tests with clear documentation, so that I can quickly understand and fix test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test fails THEN the error message SHALL clearly indicate what was expected vs actual
2. WHEN reviewing test code THEN each test SHALL follow AAA pattern with clear comments
3. WHEN adding new tests THEN developers SHALL have documented patterns and examples to follow
4. IF test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be centralized in Tests/Utilities for reuse

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each dialog service implementation handles only dialog concerns
- **Interface Segregation**: IDialogService exposes only essential dialog operations
- **Dependency Injection**: MainWindow and other UI components receive IDialogService via constructor
- **Testability**: All new code must achieve â‰¥90% code coverage

### Performance
- **Response Time**: All performance tests must validate sub-100ms constraints
- **Test Execution**: E2E tests must complete within 30 seconds total (existing requirement)
- **No Regression**: Fixing E2E tests must not slow down test suite execution

### Reliability
- **Test Stability**: E2E tests must pass consistently (no flakiness)
- **Error Messages**: Test failures must provide actionable error messages
- **Isolation**: Tests must not depend on each other or external state

### Maintainability
- **Documentation**: All test patterns must be documented in TESTING.md
- **Code Quality**: Test code must meet same quality standards as production code
- **Reusability**: Test utilities and fixtures must be reusable across test categories
