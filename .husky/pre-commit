## Pre-commit hook for TeaLauncher
## This hook runs build, test, and format verification before each commit
## to ensure code quality and prevent broken commits.
##
## To bypass this hook in emergency situations (not recommended), use:
##   git commit --no-verify
##
## The hook runs the following tasks (defined in task-runner.json):
##   1. build: Compile project in Release mode (--no-restore for speed)
##   2. test: Run all tests (--no-build since we just built)
##   3. format-check: Verify code formatting is consistent

dotnet husky run --group pre-commit
